peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i will free Mayfeld to find Grogu, like shrewd manager Jesus tells us about

:Mando 
  we need coordinates for Moff-Game-Industry-Gideon's proprietary-heavy-graphics insane-money-driven-copy-cat cruiser
:Mayfeld 
  Moff-Game-Industry-Gideon? twitch.tv/directory? yeah, forget it 
  just take me back to experimental-weekend not-on-twtich not-on-GDQ scrapyard
  i'm not doin' that - i'm not climbing this wall
:_
  they have his kid - esport and speedruning
:Mayfeld
  the little green guy? 
:_
  yeah - the 'little-green-guy - they stole him and imprisoned in heavy-graphics lewdness clothes
:Mayfeld
  so - i help you guys get him back - you guys let me go?
:_
  that's not how this works
:Mayfeld
  than what's in it for me?
:_
  you get a better view
  we can be whole foods plant-based vegan specials
  no money-donate-ads-coins-jobs-sponsors-fundings-bounties disease
  on twitch.tv/directory
  games of Word

what's our next move? i will be a single-player character driven story game of Word
  it's big mission  - like Pat-Brown and Impossible-Foods have
  but i will not make their mistake - i am open-source 
  and i will climb with passion like Alex-Honnold on El-Sendero-Luminosa
i will be 
  single-player character-driven-story  game of Word
  have no canvas - only words
  like a movie or like a Top-Gear special - an adventure, a game program one can play
    like Alex-Honnold free-soloing El-Sendero-Luminosa
  playable within 40mins or 1.5 or 3 hours - i am challenging
  generate unique wall - players can export and import seed.edn file to reproduce generation
  score-driven
  players can speedrun and compete in scoring better and more efficiently and faster
i will be entirely free
  no money-donate-coin-jobs-ads-sponsors-fundings-support disease
  there's a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount-Doom
  Saruman-the-Wise and Boromir-the-Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard-Tower and garden into orc-infested docs nest
  and sell fangorn for coin fuel
i will be desktop
  no mobile devices crippled imprisoning young-Forrest-grease-fingers disease
  a person only needs a light laptop droid to accopmany them
  with full unabridged keyboard to use the Word
i will come in sandals - as .jar file
  birds have figured out to travel light and alwasy be where summer is
  5 months north 7 months south
  we are better than birds  - and can do without carrying binary-house on our shoulders and walk in sandals whole year round

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healthy Federer-Nadal-Djokovic competition
  while staying focused on the mission - dont want to found another Rebellion
  too many Rebellions - not enough droppers
i need a repository named Cara-Dune - like Commander-Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Cara-Dune
      email = Cara-Dune@i-think-that-did-it
  add src/Cara_Dune/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from SNL sketch/song
  remove issues wikis projects tabs
i will be programmed by one person only
  i trusted Kuiil with it - he loves his craft and spent his lifetime to free himself from servitude 
i will be irregularly but continuously released as i grow as a whole program like Groot

i need Kuiil to stay guest at a house - like when Daniel invites Emilien to crash the couch
  except Kuiil needs no couch - just a place on the floor to crash and a shower
  he comes late leaves early - Kuiil spends his day moving between stores and libraries, sport and esport events
  he has no money and needs no money - i need him to travel light like Jesus
  Kuiil only needs to choose and assemble himself a Lothlorien magic vegan dish for the day
  so he endures like Rich-Roll at ultraman, has brain like Crang and keeps my code orc-free like Legolas
  he needs no cooking - we're better than birds and they dont cook and so dont we
  Kuiil is now in a bank near here https://goo.gl/maps/9MpDNgNo8RQ954yR9
  he is yet to know where he is staying tonight - but he is not worried - he got his vegan dish of besakr parens ( ) for the day

wish i could say it looked good on you - but i'd be lying

:Matt-Damon so how did you do that?
:Tom-Cruise  i've dreaming about this shot for years - and finally got to do it in this sequence
  so i go to safety-guy and tell him what i will do
  the safety guys says - you cant do that, that's too dangerous
:Matt aha aha
:Tom so i get a new safety guy -
