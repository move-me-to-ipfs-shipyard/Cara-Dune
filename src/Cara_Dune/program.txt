peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i will host Mando on his quest like Zacchaeus welcomes Jesus for dinner

:_ 
  drop you browser-service weapon
:Co-Pilot 
  no, no - you listen to me 
  this evil-Galctus-cloud-market is a top-tier of the New Peer-to-Peer Republic
  this is a lethal Borg-of-money copy-cat game industry sickening production clone engineer
  and if they found out that he's dead because of you - you're gonna wish you never left no-networking Alderaan
  i saw the desktop tear - you wanna know else what i saw? i saw your desktop-programs-planet destroyed
  i was on the Death-Cloud-Star
:_
  which one? the one before torrents with trackers or the one before torrents with DHT?
:Co-Pilot
  you think you're funny? do you know how many millions were lost in that traffic?
:_
  drop your frontend-backend blaster - it's desktop time and as Mando says - peer-to-peer, this is the way
:Co-Pilot
  as the galaxy cheered - for illegal torrent food traffic
:_
  last chance - go whole foods plant-clojure based vegan
:Co-Pilot
  destroying your planet - turning the world into giant money-service
  was a small price to pay to rid the galaxy of freedom-terrorism

Karga asked me to finish his mission - host Mando on his quest - i will be multiplayer peer-to-peer game for twtich users
  it's a action-packed mission and will climb it with passion like Alex Honnold on El Sendero Luminosa
i am not Mando
  i lack his no-compromise firmity
  but i am his host and thus will get his reward - be a free hungry-twitch-feeding true multiplayer game
i will not have programming lanugage with mouse gameplay
  player can choose to just use mouse or both or just progamming language gameplay
  editor on the left and 2D canvas on the right ot reflect the state changing
  this is exactly the new gameplay twitch streamers and players are hungry for, can compete and streamers
  programming lanugage is most unlimited uncapped form of creation like writing
  i'll base the map on an episode from Mandalorian series - Believer
  and turn that into Top Gear interview - whole foods plant based bowl
  i will generate state and put it into Little-Rock's channels like sequence of events
  i will have processes of the game prewritten for other characters and map and send that generated state to them one value at a time
  Cara-Dune's and other processes player is reponsible for will receive channels to take from and put to
  and so the map will change and characters move - all in a sequence of steps via Little-Rocks's channels
  there is a generated stream of events - values - that is a several channels with locations in them
  i take values and move on the map - and out goal is to get to Mof Gideon who has Grogu - or rather the Data Stick
  and i put values to Mando's channel - and Mayfeld maybe here as well - so they move also
  so my moevement is partially a choice but more a stream of values
  and it's not me who is statinoary and processing events - rather us moving and stream being locations
i will not have programming language gameplay
    you dont shoot a movie while watching it
    and you dont grow a fruit while eating it
    mouse and keyboard
i will not use Conquiztador or Heroes III or games alike - a different game - as i said, i am not Mando
i will take best from
  IPFS - run alongside IFPS node and use http-api for pubsub mutliplayer networking - Karga already gave me the datastick
  Voobly - give players ability to host and find games
  Starcraft - be a competitive game users will choose for tournaments
i will be desktop - as if that needs clarifying when one drops onto programming-a-program battlefield
  and not mobile - Andriod-iOS mistake is like Vogons bureaucracy
  confused programmers from new programs 
  and traps in another new browser-like limited prison
  with no keyboard but young-Forrest-Gump-greesy-fingers touch-screen tunnel
  no need for mobile devices ever - a light laptop is better in every situation giving a person a true keyboard 
  and honor of unabridged writing and programming
i will be terminal program with jvm runtime and browser ui
i will have users and identity
  but i will not store data in distributed way - i am not Mando
  i will do my best without cooking - i am in assmble-only mode
  with slight-microwave-Ron-Weasley-magic touch max
  too many libraries - not enough programs
i will not be evil will free  - but will be always free open-source and notion-of-money free
  no donate-ads-coins-sponsor-buttons-links fatal disease
  no Starlord's corporate dad Ego anywhere inside my repository confused
  his spread-my-self-everywhere to pollute Tython temple is cancelled
  because i host Mando and get Mando's reward

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healthy Djokovic-Federer-Nadal competition
  while staying focused on the mission - be peer-to-peer remake-derived multiplayer game for twitch users
  don't want to rule Navaro or found another guild - too many rulers not enough rebel-program-droppers
i will IPFS for networking
  simple as Game Changers - it already works and can be served in vegan jar of beskar parens ( )
  and user only needs to - install java, install-run IPFS Desktop, run my .jar
i need a repository named Cara-Dune - in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Cara-Dune
      email = Cara-Dune@i-think-that-did-it
    
    # git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  add src/Cara_Dune/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove issues-discussions-projects-wiki tabs from repository
i will be programmed by one person only - i trusted Kuiil with it
  i saw him built a new pram with the skill of his hands and i trust Mando and Karga
  and he has IG-11 droids with him - to nurse and protect
i will have no explicit salt - i will not provoke The-Client, we are numbered
  but i am ivisible salty - like Obi-Wan Kenobi says in the trailer - stay hidden
the only A6-Juggenaut i will drive is  - twitch can play a whole foods plant based multiplayer vegan version of their game

i need from Kuiil what Mando says he needs from Kuiil
  and - Kuiil only needs a sleeping-mat/bag to crush
  couch is too much like Emiliy the-Sink Blunt says in SNL's The Sink sketch

son of a muddscuffer!


:Ryan-Reynolds Hugh, good luck with your little show - i'll be watching
